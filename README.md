# Task-5-OOP-2
# Animal Kingdom Classification

## Overview

This JavaScript project models the classification system for the Animal Kingdom, employing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The code represents various animal groups, their characteristics, and specific behaviors. The project showcases key OOP concepts, including Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism.

## Features

- **Dynamic Subclass Creation:** Utilizes a method to dynamically generate subclasses, allowing representation of specific animal classifications within the kingdom.
- **Encapsulation and Abstraction:** Implements getters and setters for controlled property access and abstract methods representing common behaviors.
- **Polymorphism:** Demonstrates polymorphic behavior through overridden methods in specific subclasses.

# Classes
## Animal
Represents the base class for animals and includes attributes such as name, type, and cold-blooded status. This class serves as a foundation for creating specific animal subclasses.

# Subclasses (e.g., Fish, Mammal)
Dynamically generated subclasses using the createSubclass method. Each subclass inherits properties and methods from the base Animal class, showcasing Inheritance.

# Dog, Goldfish, etc.
Specific subclasses with unique attributes and behaviors, demonstrating Polymorphism.
